# Kanu-s.a.M.
Main program of my time measurement system for Kanu sports.

Install Kanu s.a.M.
Go to subfolder "dist/bundles", click at the .exe-file (the Installer) and select "Download". After this, run the Installer.
If the Installer does not work, please make sure you are running Java 8 Update 60 or above. Go back to the folder "Kanu s.a.M.", click "Clone or download" and "Download ZIP". You can run the Program from the folder dist/Kanu_s.a.M..jar.

Configure Kanu s.a.M.
Please download the software XAMPP for your plattform, e.g. from https://www.apachefriends.org/de/download.html (official website). 
Open "XAMPP Control Panel", click the Button "Config" (German: "Konfig") and click at the RadioButtons "Apache" and "MySQL" in the section "automatic start" (or similar; German: "Module automatisch starten").
Restart XAMPP. Open your browser, type "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/". Click the Button "new" at the left side to create a new database. Enter a name (e.g. "android_connect") and click at "create". It is strongly recommended that you set up a password for MySQL.
Save the values for username, password and database. They will be needed to run the software properly.

Note
At a few computers, autostart for XAMPP will not work. If your app refuses the connection, please open the smartphone's browser and enter "http://IP of your PC". If no site appears, check your network. Open XAMPP Control Panel and if Apache or MySQL indicate red or yellow stop and restart them.

Support
In the folders "Plakat", "Pr√§sentation" and "Dokumentation" you can find more information about the software's aims, development process and usage (only in German).
